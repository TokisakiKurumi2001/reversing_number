# reversing_number
Reverse the number by different approach

# Old approach:
Modulo and integer divide to get the number
## Advantage:
- Simple, arithmetic operation required
## Disadvantage:
- Dealing with long number seems to be very hard to achieve

# New approach:
## Using built-in function:
Convert number to string and use built-in function to reverse the string then return
### Advantage:
- Dealing with big number is a piece of cake
### Disadvantage:
- Some programming language doesn't have built-in `reverse` string function
- Require some simple knowledge when dealing with string

## Handmade reverse function:
Instead of using built-in function, we implement our own `reverse` function
### Advantage:
- Like using built-in function
### Disadvantage:
- Dealing string in some low-level programming language may require strong basic CS knowledge
